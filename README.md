# VP-Digi
Polska wersja tego pliku dostÄ™pna jest [tutaj](README_pl.md).

**VP-Digi** is a functional, affordable, easy-to-assemble, and configure STM32-based APRS digipeater controller with a built-in KISS modem.

* Multiple modems:
  * 1200 Bd AFSK Bell 202 (VHF standard)
  * 300 Bd AFSK Bell 103 (HF standard)
  * 9600 Bd GFSK G3RUH (UHF standard)
  * 1200 Bd AFSK V.23
* PWM (or deprecated R2R) signal generation
* Analog-digital busy channel detection (data carrier detection)
* AX.25 coder/decoder
* FX.25 (AX.25 with error correction) coder/decoder, fully compatible with [Direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf) and [UZ7HO Soundmodem](http://uz7.ho.ua/packetradio.htm)
* Digipeater: 4 settable n-N aliases, 4 simple aliases, viscous delay (known from aprx) or direct only, black and white list
* 8 independent beacons
* KISS mode (can be used as an ordinary Packet Radio, Winlink, APRS, etc. modem)
* USB and 2 UARTs: independent, running in KISS, monitor, or configuration mode
* 40-50 mA current consumption
  
## Download and setup
The latest compiled firmware can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/sq8vps/vp-digi/releases).\
Full documentation can be found [here](doc/manual.md).

## Updating to 2.0.0+ on older hardware

Since version 2.0.0, the component values have changed to provide support for faster modulations (9600 Bd). If you want to use these, some components must be replaced. For more information, refer to the [manual](doc/manual.md).

## Description, schematic, instructions

The user manual and technical description are available [here](doc/manual.md).

## Source code

The firmware was written using STM32CubeIDE, and you should be able to import this repository directly into the IDE. You can get the source code using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sq8vps/vp-digi.git
```
Since version 2.0.0, you will also need to get the appropriate submodule ([LwFEC](https://github.com/sq8vps/lwfec) for Reed-Solomon FEC):

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Since version 2.0.0, there is also a possibility to build the firmware with or without FX.25 protocol support. The `ENABLE_FX25` symbol must be defined to enable FX.25 support. On STM32CubeIDE, this can be done under *Project->Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Preprocessor->Defined symbols*.
